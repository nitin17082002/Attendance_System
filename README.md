# Smart-Attendance-system

PROBLEM STATEMENT  :

The existing attendance system requires students to manually sign the sheet every time they attend a class.
This includes the more time consumed by the students to find their name on sheet,
some students may mistakenly signed another studentâ€™s name and the sometimes sheet may got lost.


The approach to the problem is by the introduction of face recognition system to replace the traditional 
attendance  method so that the system will automatically keep a digital record of attendance of students,
teachers and working professionals using face recognition system.
